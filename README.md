# improved-waddle-12

## Description
The Module 12 Challenge demonstrates the use of MySQL to create and manage a company's employee database

## Installation
To install this database and its features, you will need to clone my repository from GitHub onto a local directory by entering this code into your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/hipster-rufus/improved-waddle-12.git`

## Usage
Once the repo has been cloned, be sure to install the required dependencies: `npm install`<br>
Install the database in your terminal using MySQL:<br>
    `mysql -u root -p`<br>
    `source db/schema.sql`<br>
    `source db/seeds.sql`<br>
    `quit`<br>
Then start the server: `npm start`<br>
This will prompt a menu of options to view, add, and update the company database! Choose from departments, roles and employees.
